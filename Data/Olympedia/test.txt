Teddy Riner, the country’s flagbearer during the Opening Ceremony and one of the heavy favorites, successfully defended his gold medal from London. The 2.04 m tall, almost 140 kg giant, continued his winning streak at European and World Championships, as well as Olympic Games, because his last major defeat was in the final of the 2010 World Championships. In the quarter-final in Rio, Riner opposed the home favorite Rafael da Silva. Although Silva received three penalties, he survived the regular period of five minutes but was eventually defeated by a Waza-ari (half point) by Riner. In the semi-final, Riner had to once more go the full distance against Israel’s Or Sasson, again winning by a Waza-ari with Sumi-gaeshi (corner throw) in the last second.\nThe other half of the draw was dominated by Japan’s Hisayoshi Harasawa. After a difficult start in his first bout, he dominated his remaining opponents , winning the next three fights by Ippon (full point). The final was between the two dominant judokas in this division, Riner and Harasawa, but the gold medal was finally decided based on Shidos (penalties), with two given to Harasawa early in the bout and one to Riner half a minute from the final bell. This was enough for Riner to clinch the gold, leaving silver for Harasawa. The bronze medals went to two of Riner’s victims, Rafael Silva and Or Sasson.\nIn his first contest of the day, Sasson met Egypt’s Islam El-Shehaby, a fixture overshadowed by political issues. When the Israeli won by Ippon, El-Shehaby refused to shake hands or bow, the normal gesture of appreciation after any encounter in judo. Consequently, the Egyptian was booed by the crowd. Allegedly, he had been under pressure by nationalists and Islamists not to compete at all.\n

Each team could nominate a maximum of twelve athletes, of which a maximum of six entered the mat in each round. As soon as one team won four of the six bouts it was declared the winner and proceeded to the next round. In case of a 3-3 draw, an additional decisive bout was scheduled. At World Championships, the format was introduced in 2018, and in all four finals France faced Japan with Japan winning the title at every occasion. Based on the results of the individual events, this seemed to be the logical outcome also at the Olympics. So far, Japan won nine gold and one bronze and France one gold, three silver and three bronze, of which only two bronze came from the men’s events.\nBoth teams were spared from the elimination round, just like the teams of the Russian Olympic Committee and Brazil, two potential contenders for bronze. In the quarter-final, Japan, calling up six gold medallists, defeated Germany 4-2, but only after being behind 0-2. France also had a hard time beating Israel 4-3, when the extra fight had to be decided by Golden Score. While the Russian victory over Mongolia did not come unexpectedly, the Netherlands scored a 4-2 upset over Brazil, bronze medallist at the last two World Championships. Brazil was finally eliminated in the repêchage by Israel. Germany made the bronze medal contest by defeating Mongolia.\nIn the semi-finals, Japan and France scored one-sided 4-0 wins against the ROC and the Netherlands, respectively, without having to go into extra-time in any of the matches. The bronze medals were eventually taken by the dark horse Israel and Germany. In the final, four gold medallists represented Japan: Shohei Ono, Chizuru Arai, Akira Sone, and Aaron Wolf, and they were complemented by bronze medallist Tsukasa Yoshida and ninth placed Shoichiro Mukai. The French team consisted of Clarisse Agbegnenou (silver), Sarah-Léonie Cysique (silver), Romane Dicko and Teddy Riner (both bronze), and non-medallists Axel Clerget, and Guillaume Chaine. Agbegnenou moved up one category and collected two Waza-aris (half points) to defeat the Japanese gold medallist Arai. Clerget threw Mukai by Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) in extra-time for a 2-0 lead. Sone, who already won gold on the day before, outscored Dicko by two Waza-ari to revive Japan’s hopes. French heavyweight legend Teddy Riner then scored a Waza-ari for the Golden Score in the clash of gold medallists defeating half-heavyweight Wolf to give France a comfortable lead. Sarah-Léonie Cysique held on to an early lead by Waza-ari against Yoshida to earn France the fourth point and, hence, the gold medal.

Tangriyev advanced to the final where he faced Japan’s Satoshi Ishii, the 2007 World University Games champion. The final match was close, but Ishii prevailed by yuko to win the gold medal. After the Olympics he upset the Japanese judo community by leaving the sport to sign a huge contract to compete in Mixed Martial Arts.  Riner would come back in the repêchage to win a bronze, with the other bronze going to Cuba’s Oscar Braison, the 2008 World Cup Champion.\n

He did not disappoint, moving to the final against Aleksandr Mikhaylin. Mikhaylin had survived in the quarters, defeating Brazil’s Rafael da Silva by judges’ decision, and then winning on a golden score over German Andreas Tölzer in the semi-finals. The final saw no offensive points scored, as Riner won the gold medal by accumulated penalties, with Mikhaylin given shido warnings for defensive posture, for leaving the tatami, and for non-combativity. Tölzer and da Silva shared the bronze medals.\n

Fourth seed Hisayoshi Harasawa just narrowly missed a medal, squeezed out by Frenchman Teddy Riner. Lukáš Krpálek from the Czech Republic clinched his second gold after his victory in the half-heavyweight at the 2016 Olympics. He was also seventh at London 2012. In both categories he was a world champion, in the heavyweight in 2019 and half-heavyweight in 2014. Krpálek only required extra time for a Golden Score in his semi-final against Harasawa after 7:59 min. In the final he faced Guram Tushishvili from Georgia, Krpálek’s predecessor as world champion in 2018. Although the Czech was charged with two Shidos (penalties) after less than three minutes into the bout, he returned to win by scoring two Waza-aris (half points) within 20 seconds of the final minute. Tushishvili toppled all his previous opponents by Ippon (full point), and, like Krpálek, required the Golden Score just once, against 2012 and 2016 bronze medallist Rafael Silva in the quarter-final. Third seed Tamerlan Bashayev, Tushishvili’s opponent in the semi-final, won his fight for bronze. Bashayev ousted the favourite, French giant Riner, in the quarter-final. The outcome of this fight was still considered a surprise, regardless of the ranking list, and Bashayev’s silver at the 2021 World Championships.\nRiner, however, bronze medallist in 2008 at the age of 19 and gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, secured a bronze medal in the repêchage when Harasawa was disqualified for non-combativity after receiving his third Shido. Riner was definitely one of the most successful judokas of the last decade, winning medals in the heavyweight at four consecutive Olympic Games. In Tokyo, he added yet another gold medal to his tally, winning the mixed team event with France.\n result_id                       event_title              edition  edition_id sport               sport_url            result_date                                                            result_location  result_participants                                                                                                                                                                                                             result_format result_detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               result_description

Teddy Riner, the country’s flagbearer during the Opening Ceremony and one of the heavy favorites, successfully defended his gold medal from London. The 2.04 m tall, almost 140 kg giant, continued his winning streak at European and World Championships, as well as Olympic Games, because his last major defeat was in the final of the 2010 World Championships. In the quarter-final in Rio, Riner opposed the home favorite Rafael da Silva. Although Silva received three penalties, he survived the regular period of five minutes but was eventually defeated by a Waza-ari (half point) by Riner. In the semi-final, Riner had to once more go the full distance against Israel’s Or Sasson, again winning by a Waza-ari with Sumi-gaeshi (corner throw) in the last second.\nThe other half of the draw was dominated by Japan’s Hisayoshi Harasawa. After a difficult start in his first bout, he dominated his remaining opponents , winning the next three fights by Ippon (full point). The final was between the two dominant judokas in this division, Riner and Harasawa, but the gold medal was finally decided based on Shidos (penalties), with two given to Harasawa early in the bout and one to Riner half a minute from the final bell. This was enough for Riner to clinch the gold, leaving silver for Harasawa. The bronze medals went to two of Riner’s victims, Rafael Silva and Or Sasson.\nIn his first contest of the day, Sasson met Egypt’s Islam El-Shehaby, a fixture overshadowed by political issues. When the Israeli won by Ippon, El-Shehaby refused to shake hands or bow, the normal gesture of appreciation after any encounter in judo. Consequently, the Egyptian was booed by the crowd. Allegedly, he had been under pressure by nationalists and Islamists not to compete at all.\n

Each team could nominate a maximum of twelve athletes, of which a maximum of six entered the mat in each round. As soon as one team won four of the six bouts it was declared the winner and proceeded to the next round. In case of a 3-3 draw, an additional decisive bout was scheduled. At World Championships, the format was introduced in 2018, and in all four finals France faced Japan with Japan winning the title at every occasion. Based on the results of the individual events, this seemed to be the logical outcome also at the Olympics. So far, Japan won nine gold and one bronze and France one gold, three silver and three bronze, of which only two bronze came from the men’s events.\nBoth teams were spared from the elimination round, just like the teams of the Russian Olympic Committee and Brazil, two potential contenders for bronze. In the quarter-final, Japan, calling up six gold medallists, defeated Germany 4-2, but only after being behind 0-2. France also had a hard time beating Israel 4-3, when the extra fight had to be decided by Golden Score. While the Russian victory over Mongolia did not come unexpectedly, the Netherlands scored a 4-2 upset over Brazil, bronze medallist at the last two World Championships. Brazil was finally eliminated in the repêchage by Israel. Germany made the bronze medal contest by defeating Mongolia.\nIn the semi-finals, Japan and France scored one-sided 4-0 wins against the ROC and the Netherlands, respectively, without having to go into extra-time in any of the matches. The bronze medals were eventually taken by the dark horse Israel and Germany. In the final, four gold medallists represented Japan: Shohei Ono, Chizuru Arai, Akira Sone, and Aaron Wolf, and they were complemented by bronze medallist Tsukasa Yoshida and ninth placed Shoichiro Mukai. The French team consisted of Clarisse Agbegnenou (silver), Sarah-Léonie Cysique (silver), Romane Dicko and Teddy Riner (both bronze), and non-medallists Axel Clerget, and Guillaume Chaine. Agbegnenou moved up one category and collected two Waza-aris (half points) to defeat the Japanese gold medallist Arai. Clerget threw Mukai by Sumi-otoshi (corner drop) in extra-time for a 2-0 lead. Sone, who already won gold on the day before, outscored Dicko by two Waza-ari to revive Japan’s hopes. French heavyweight legend Teddy Riner then scored a Waza-ari for the Golden Score in the clash of gold medallists defeating half-heavyweight Wolf to give France a comfortable lead. Sarah-Léonie Cysique held on to an early lead by Waza-ari against Yoshida to earn France the fourth point and, hence, the gold medal.

Tangriyev advanced to the final where he faced Japan’s Satoshi Ishii, the 2007 World University Games champion. The final match was close, but Ishii prevailed by yuko to win the gold medal. After the Olympics he upset the Japanese judo community by leaving the sport to sign a huge contract to compete in Mixed Martial Arts.  Riner would come back in the repêchage to win a bronze, with the other bronze going to Cuba’s Oscar Braison, the 2008 World Cup Champion.\n

He did not disappoint, moving to the final against Aleksandr Mikhaylin. Mikhaylin had survived in the quarters, defeating Brazil’s Rafael da Silva by judges’ decision, and then winning on a golden score over German Andreas Tölzer in the semi-finals. The final saw no offensive points scored, as Riner won the gold medal by accumulated penalties, with Mikhaylin given shido warnings for defensive posture, for leaving the tatami, and for non-combativity. Tölzer and da Silva shared the bronze medals.\n

Fourth seed Hisayoshi Harasawa just narrowly missed a medal, squeezed out by Frenchman Teddy Riner. Lukáš Krpálek from the Czech Republic clinched his second gold after his victory in the half-heavyweight at the 2016 Olympics. He was also seventh at London 2012. In both categories he was a world champion, in the heavyweight in 2019 and half-heavyweight in 2014. Krpálek only required extra time for a Golden Score in his semi-final against Harasawa after 7:59 min. In the final he faced Guram Tushishvili from Georgia, Krpálek’s predecessor as world champion in 2018. Although the Czech was charged with two Shidos (penalties) after less than three minutes into the bout, he returned to win by scoring two Waza-aris (half points) within 20 seconds of the final minute. Tushishvili toppled all his previous opponents by Ippon (full point), and, like Krpálek, required the Golden Score just once, against 2012 and 2016 bronze medallist Rafael Silva in the quarter-final. Third seed Tamerlan Bashayev, Tushishvili’s opponent in the semi-final, won his fight for bronze. Bashayev ousted the favourite, French giant Riner, in the quarter-final. The outcome of this fight was still considered a surprise, regardless of the ranking list, and Bashayev’s silver at the 2021 World Championships.\nRiner, however, bronze medallist in 2008 at the age of 19 and gold medallist in 2012 and 2016, secured a bronze medal in the repêchage when Harasawa was disqualified for non-combativity after receiving his third Shido. Riner was definitely one of the most successful judokas of the last decade, winning medals in the heavyweight at four consecutive Olympic Games. In Tokyo, he added yet another gold medal to his tally, winning the mixed team event with France.\n
